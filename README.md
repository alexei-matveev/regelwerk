# Simulate Rule-Engine with Datalog

To keep thing simple and see where  it leads us we postulate here that
a  rule or  a rule  set  is just  a  function of  facts producing  new
facts. No more, no less.

See [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) dialect of
Datalog.

  "text" bei executing Rules
